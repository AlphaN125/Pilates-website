    <p>1. Perform side kicks. Lie straight and flat on your right side with your right arm extended out under you. Lift your head, neck, and chest slightly off the ground and bend your right arm at the elbow to prop up your head. Keep your hips and legs stacked on top of one another, and bend slightly at the hip so your feet are sticking out at a bit of an angle.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Place your left hand on the ground in front of your torso for support.</li>
        <li>Raise your left leg slightly, flex your left foot, and kick your left leg out in front of you 90 degrees.</li>
        <li>Swing it back to its starting position and kick it out behind you as you point your foot.</li>
        <li>Repeat for a total of 10 kicks forward and back, then switch sides and repeat.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2. Do on the spot knee raises. Stand up straight and stick your elbows out in front at shoulder height as you cross your hands to the opposite shoulders. Lift your right knee toward your right elbow as high as you can (this is one step). Drop your leg and lift your left knee toward your left elbow (this is a second step).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Take 20 steps in total.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>3. Use the wall as a chair. Stand with your back straight against a wall. With your feet hip-width apart, sink down lower and bend your knees as you walk your feet out. Stop when your legs form a 90-degree angle. Keep your back against the wall, raise your arms out straight in front of you (parallel to the ground).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hold for 30 seconds. Take a 10 second break and repeat once.</li>
    </ul>
