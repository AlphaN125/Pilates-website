    <p>1. Do some abdominal rolls. These three positions begin with you sitting up straight with your legs extended out straight directly in front of you. Raise your arms and extend them out straight so they're parallel with your legs. Lower your head and curl yourself back as you bend your knees. Stop when you've leaned back about halfway and raise your arms.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Inhale slowly. Exhale, lower your arms, and curl back up to a straight back.</li>
        <li>Repeat six to eight times.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2. Stretch your spine. Separate your legs a little more than hip-width apart. Flex your feet and point your toes at the ceiling. Raise your arms straight out in front of you, shoulder-width apart. Round your back into a C so your neck and head bow forward and stretch your arms forward. Inhale slowly, and slowly straighten back out as you exhale.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Repeat four more times.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>3. Do the saw. Separate your legs a little more than hip-width apart. Extend your arms straight out to your sides. Gently twist to your left and stretch your right hand to your left foot. Inhale slowly.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Exhale and bring your body back to center.</li>
        <li>Twist to the right and stretch your left hand to your right foot.</li>
        <li>Inhale slowly. Return to center.</li>
        <li>Alternate twisting to the left and right for a total of three times.</li>
    </ul>
