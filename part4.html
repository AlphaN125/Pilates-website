    <p>1. Perform a basic plank. Get on your hands and knees. Position your wrists under your shoulders, and your knees under your hips. Keep the balls of your toes on the floor and bring your feet into a walking position (as though your feet were flat on the floor).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shift your weight to your hands and the balls of your feet as you lift your knees and legs off the floor and straighten your body into a line.</li>
        <li>Hold for 10 seconds, or longer if you can.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2. Kick like a donkey. From plank position, lift your right leg back and toward the ceiling. Then lower it, bend your right knee, tuck your head down, and bring your knee in toward your nose. Extend your leg back out and repeat four more times.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Return to plank and repeat with the other leg.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>3. Try the inverted plank. Sit on your bum with your legs stretched out in front of you. Place your hands on either side of your body, just slightly behind your bum, with your fingertips facing toward your legs. Keep your feet on the floor, point your toes, and straighten your legs as you lift your bum and legs off the floor with your arms.</p>
